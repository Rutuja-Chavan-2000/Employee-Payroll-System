# Employee-Payroll-System

**Introduction**

Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration of building a terminal-based Employee Payroll System utilizing the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In this project, we focus on designing a robust system by leveraging key OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. By exploring these concepts, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to structure and manage employee data and payroll calculations effectively.


**Project Structure**

**üèóÔ∏è Abstract Employee Class and Concrete Subclasses:**

The project features an abstract Employee class, serving as the foundation for different employee types.
Concrete subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee demonstrate specialized salary calculation methods tailored to specific employee types.

**üíº Salary Calculation:**

The system includes salary calculation mechanisms for both full-time and part-time employees, showcasing real-world scenarios of salary computation based on employment type.


**üöÄ Core Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:**

Demonstrates key OOP principles:
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism.
